# PREVIOUS PROJECTS
Here are a collection of different mini projects I've done on the side over the years!

- A Casino Guessing game that gets a player to place a deposit and guess a random number with the amount of money they want to bet with to win/lose money.

- A compound interest program that tracks the amount of compound interest a person generates over a certain amount of years.

- A caesar encryption program.

- A hangman game in which a word is given and a user has to guess it.

- A speed typer game.

- a funny madlibs game in which you're given a scenario and a user has to fill in the blanks with words using user input (e.g, verbs, nouns adjectives) and makes an even funnier scenario.
